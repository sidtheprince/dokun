dokun C++ guidelines:

File
- file names should be lowercase and can have an underscore.
- all cpp files should have a header file, headers do not need their own cpp files.
Namespace
- namespaces should be lowercase and can have underscore.
- never use "using namespace std;" as naming conflictions could occur.

use "std::" instead. This applies to all namespaces.
